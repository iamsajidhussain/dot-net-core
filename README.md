Let's look at the **.NET Core CLI** and its primary operations: **new**, **build**, **publish**, **run**, **test**.

### New

The **new** command initializes a new .NET project using a specific template. You can choose from project types like console applications, web applications, class libraries, and more.

### Build

With the **build** command, you can compile your source code into an executable format or a library. It also resolves project dependencies and creates an assembly.

### Publish

The **publish** command gathers necessary components for an application, like the .NET Core runtime, and **prepares it for deployment**. This ensures the target machine has the relevant runtime and runtime components.

### Run

The **run** command simplifies the process of executing your application. It does this by **combining building and execution tasks** into a single, more straightforward step.

### Test

Use the **test** command to execute tests in the project. The .NET Core Test Explorer, VS Code, or Continuous Integration (CI) systems like Azure Pipelines or Jenkins can also run these tests.

### Simplified Workflow

These CLI commands simplify the development process. You can transition from creating a new project to building, testing, and running it, all from the command line. These commands save time and make development more efficient.
<br>

## 5. How do you create a new _.NET Core project_ using the _CLI_?

To create a new **.NET Core** project using the command line:

### Step 1: Install the .NET Core SDK

If you haven't already, install the **.NET Core SDK**. This provides the necessary **tools** and **libraries** for developing in .NET.

### Step 2: Run the `dotnet new` Command

Use the `dotnet new` command to **create** a new .NET Core project. This command offers various **project templates**, such as for web APIs, console applications, and more.

Here is the syntax:

```bash
dotnet new <TEMPLATE_NAME> [-n <PROJECT_NAME>] [-o <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>]
```

- Substitute **`<TEMPLATE_NAME>`** with the desired project template like `console`, `webapi`, `mvc`, etc.
- Optionally, set a **`<PROJECT_NAME>`** and an **`<OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>`**.

### Example: Running `dotnet new` to Create a Console App

Use the following command:

```bash
dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp -o MyConsoleAppDir
```

- **TEMPLATE_NAME**: `console`
- **PROJECT_NAME**: `MyConsoleApp`
- **OUTPUT_DIRECTORY**: `MyConsoleAppDir`

This will create a new **console application project** with the name `MyConsoleApp` and place it in the `MyConsoleAppDir` folder.
<br>

## 6. Discuss the purpose and use of a `csproj` file in a _.NET Core project_.

The **C# project file** (`*.csproj`) serves as a **configuration manifest** for .NET Core projects, providing a wealth of options for customizing your build process, declaring project dependencies, and adjusting compiler settings.

The `csproj` file is based on the more general `msbuild` format and has had several iterations as new features are introduced.

Through continuous updates and community feedback, the project file remains central to the management and orchestration of .NET Core projects.
<br>

## 7. What is the _runtime_ and _SDK_ in _.NET Core_?

The **.NET Core** framework is a versatile, modular platform for developing cross-platform applications. It delivers its core libraries, tools, and runtime as an integrated package.

### Two Essential Components

1. **.NET Core Runtime**: This environment is necessary for executing .NET Core applications. It's typically distributed as a single deployable unit, ensuring that applications are self-contained and alleviating the need for separately installed .NET runtimes.

2. **.NET Core SDK**: Integrating essential tools like the compiler, NuGet package manager, and MSBuild, the SDK empowers developers to build, test, and publish applications. Its comprehensive suite of libraries and APIs supports development across a range of applications and industries.

### Compatibility Considerations

The version of the .NET Core runtime specifies the advertised **API compatibility level** and **previously introduced feature sets**.

Developers outline any framework version dependencies in their applications through the use of the `<TargetFramework>` element in the project file.

### Code Example: Project File with Target Framework

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
    <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

### Managing Multiple .NET Core Versions

The .NET Core SDK provides a command-line tool, `dotnet`, which enables you to monitor various installed versions and switch between them seamlessly. Use the `global.json` file in your project to fix the specific SDK version for your project or a range of projects.

### Code Example: Global.json

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "3.1.402"
  }
}
```
<br>

## 8. How would you manage different versions of the _.NET Core SDK_ on the same machine?

You can use **`global.json`** files and specify the version of the .NET SDK you wish to target within a project. When you run `.net build` or `.net run` in a directory that contains a global.json file, the SDK version specified in that file takes precedence over any other installed versions.

Here is a code snippet showing how to write a `global.json` file:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "2.1.402"
  }
}
```
<br>

## 9. What is the purpose of the `global.json` file?

The `global.json` file in a .NET Core project defines the version of the SDK used and allows for **multi-project management**.

It also assists with:

- **Managing SDK Versions**: By setting the `sdk` field to a specific version, you ensure consistent behavior across development environments and CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, the `allowPrerelease` flag gives you control over using preview versions.

- **Setting Default Paths for Global Packages and Tools**: The `packageManagement` and `tools` fields can be helpful in specifying directory paths for global tools and packages. This can simplify configuration on new machines or during deployment. For instance, you can use it to set up the same configuration across machines of your team.

- **Coordinating Multi-Project Solutions**: A `global.json` file helps manage **consistent SDK versions and ensures that inter-related projects within a solution are either using the same version or compatible ones. This coordination is essential for projects that *depend* on each other, especially in a CI/CD environment.

### Global SDK vs. Local SDK

The SDK version specified in the `global.json` usually supersedes the locally installed SDK version unless the local version is explicitly pinned, or there's a higher priority, such as in a project-specific `global.json` file.

**When shared**, the `global.json` settings apply to all projects within its directory and those in subdirectories unless they have their own `global.json` files, which would then take precedence.

**If you're pushing software to production**, always account for SDK versions and set up your CI/CD pipelines accordingly. For consistency and to guard against unintended version updates, you should generally specify the SDK versions in your build configurations, rather than relying solely on the local environment of the build agent or developer machines.
<br>

## 10. Can you explain the _Directory Structure_ of a typical _.NET Core project_?

The directory structure of a typical .NET Core project is designed to keep code organized and manageable.

### Key Directories

- **Uninstalling**: Use the "Installed" tab to remove packages.

### Managing Packages via .NET CLI

Use the `dotnet add package` and `dotnet remove package` commands.

#### Syntax

- **Add Package**:
  ```bash
  dotnet add package PackageName
  ```
- **Remove Package**:
  ```bash
  dotnet remove package PackageName
  ```

- **Update Package**:
  ```bash
  dotnet add package PackageName --version 1.2.3
  ```


#### Using Private Feeds

- **Configuring**: In `nuget.config`, define the source, or use `-s`/`--source` in the CLI. E.g.:
  ```bash
  dotnet add package CompanyPackage --source https://NuGetServer.com/nuget/MyPrivateFeed/
  ```

  **Authentication**: For authenticated feeds, use `.config` files or `-k`/`--api-key` along with the command.


### Using NuGet.Config

- **Creating**: Use the `new` command to create a config file in your solution folder:
  ```bash
  dotnet new nugetconfig
  ```

- **Configuring Sources**: With the `add source`  command:
  ```bash
  dotnet nuget add source https://AnotherFeed.com/v3/index.json --name AnotherFeed
  ```

  And to remove a source:
  ```bash
  dotnet nuget remove source AnotherFeed
  ```

- **Setting Default Push Source**: Utilize the `push` command:
  ```bash
  dotnet nuget push -t API_KEY MyPackage.1.0.0.nupkg
  ```
  Use the `-s`/`--source` switch to specify the desired push source.

### Docker and NuGet

To use a cache layer when adding packages in a Docker container, first retrieve and add the `.csproj` file to the container before executing the `dotnet restore` command. This approach speeds up the build process.

#### Dockerfile Example

```Dockerfile
# Copy .csproj and nuget.config and restore as distinct layers
COPY nuget.config ./
COPY Orcha.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore
```
<br>

## 12. Explain the role of the _NuGet package manager_.

The **NuGet Package Manager** simplifies the process of integrating external libraries and components into your project. It's a core element in the Microsoft toolchain and is closely integrated with .NET Core, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code.

### Key NuGet Package Manager Capabilities

1. **Package Management**: NuGet serves as a centralized repository for .NET packages, where developers can easily search, discover, and install packages.

2. **Dependency Management**: NuGet tracks and resolves dependencies between packages, ensuring that all required components are downloaded and installed.

3. **Version Control**: Different versions of the same package are maintained, giving developers flexibility in choosing the most suitable one for their project.

4. **Project Scopes**: NuGet allows you to define packages at various levels such as the global package store, the project-local store, or as a package reference within a project file.

5. **Commands via CLI**: Besides GUI integration, NuGet supports a powerful command-line interface for streamlined package management.

6. **Publishing Packages**: It facilitates package creators in distributing their libraries to the global NuGet repository for wider consumption.

7. **Extensibility**: NuGet allows for easy management of third-party tools and integrations, beyond just code libraries.

### NuGet in Action: A Simple Example

Here is what you should do:

- In Visual Studio, open a .NET Core project.
- Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and choose "Manage NuGet Packages".
- Click on "Browse" and search for "Newtonsoft.Json", a commonly used JSON parsing library.
- Click "Install" to add the package to your project.

This will modify your project file, adding a `<PackageReference>` to `Newtonsoft.Json` and any of its dependencies.
<br>

## 13. Describe the process of _publishing a .NET Core application_.

When publishing a **.NET Core application**, you compile it and its dependencies for deployment. .NET Core supports various publishing methods and configurations to cater to your specific requirements.

### Various Publishing Methods

1. **Framework-Dependent**: Publishes the app without the .NET Core runtime. It indicates which version to use on the target system. The app will only run on systems with matching or newer .NET Core runtimes.

2. **Self-Contained**: Packages the app with the .NET Core runtime, allowing it to run on systems without an existing .NET Core installation.

3. **Portable**: Typically suitable for use-cases like USB flash or external drives.

4. **Ready-To-Run**: Optimizes the app startup time by pre-compiling specific libraries to native code. RTR has the added benefit of being useful for promoting cross-gen and unification common. Thus, **RTR Is the default for these modes vs traditional JIT**.

### Publishing Commands

The Dotnet Command Line produces build artifacts onto the file system. 

- **dotnet build** compiles the app.
- **dotnet publish** copies necessary files to a target path, to make it ready for deployment.

### Project Files for Publishing

The following configuration settings can be specified in your project file to influence the publish process:

- **PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest**: For web apps, this setting specifies whether the app should be published with or without an AspNetCore target manifest.

- **PublishTrimmed**: When set to 'true', minimizes the number of assemblies included in the published output based on necessary. This improves performance & size.



An example DOTNET CLI command for publishing a self-contained app would look like this:

```sh
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained --runtime linux-x64
```

And for ready-to-run (RTR), it would be:

```sh
dotnet publish -c Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained false --output rtr/path
```

When the **Ready-To-Run** is specified, the `--self-contained` and `--output` are disabled.

For deploying to Linux or Windows in **framework-dependent** mode:



```sh
dotnet publish -c Release --runtime linux-x64
```

```sh
dotnet publish -c Release --runtime win-x64
```

### Repositories, NuGet & Web



-  **Repository**: Useful for sharing the project's source code publicly. Code hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket support repository management.
  
- **NuGet Package**: Ideal for publishing libraries as it simplifies their consumption. Once you've published a library to NuGet, others can include it as a dependency in their projects.
  
-  **Web Host**: For web applications and services, hosting them with a web server is essential.  When you deploy to a web server, ensure your web.config file is correctly configured for its needs. Additionally, when using Kestrel, ensure it's accessible through a proxy server.

## 14. What is a _.NET Standard_ and how does it relate to _.NET Core_?

**.NET Standard** serves as a formalized set of APIs, ensuring cross-compatibility among different .NET implementations. Essentially, it is a standardized interface that abstracts from the underlying platform.

### Motivation for .NET Standard

Before .NET Standard, developers had to detect and account for the specific platform they were targeting, such as UWP or different versions of .NET Framework. This diversity resulted in interoperability challenges.

By establishing a standardized target across .NET implementations, **.NET Standard** simplifies multi-platform development, making it more cohesive and intuitive.

### Evolution of Development Platforms

While '.NET Core' and '.NET Framework' cater to specific use cases, **.NET Standard** essentially aims for cross-compatibility. As of 2020, Microsoft advocated for using '.NET Core' for newer projects.

Here is the overview:

- **.NET Framework**: It's a mature, all-in-one development platform for Windows-based applications.
- **.NET Core**: A streamlined, open-source platform shattering Windows allegiance, targeting both Windows and non-Windows systems.
- **.NET 5**: A unification of ".NET Core" and ".NET Framework".
- **.NET 6 **: The next leap, evolving further from ".NET 5".

Given this diverse landscape, **.NET Standard** acts as an umbrella platform with defined capabilities and APIs, ensuring consistent behavior across different .NET implementations.

## 15. How do you create a _class library_ in _.NET Core_?

To create a **Class Library** in .NET Core, you can use either Visual Studio or the `dotnet` command-line interface.

### Using Visual Studio

- Open Visual Studio.
- Select "Create a new project".
- Choose the "Class Library" template under the "C#" or appropriate language heading.
- Specify the project name and location.
- Click "Create".

### Using the .NET CLI

1. **Create the Project**: Open a terminal and navigate to the desired directory. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet new classlib -n MyLibrary
   ```

   Replace `MyLibrary` with your preferred project name.

The above command will generate a `.csproj` file, which is the project file for the class library.

2. **Configure the Project Reference**:

   You can either manually add the reference or use the `dotnet add reference` command. Manually, you would do this editing the `.csproj` file:

   ```xml
   <ItemGroup>
       <ProjectReference Include="..\Path\To\AnotherProject.csproj" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

   Using the command line:

   ```bash
   dotnet add reference ..\Path\To\AnotherProject.csproj
   ```

   This connects your class library to your other projects or external libraries.

### Visual Studio Code

You can create a class library in Visual Studio Code using the .NET CLI. Here is how:

1. **Initialize the Project Folder**:

   Open the terminal in the desired directory and run:

   ```bash
   dotnet new sln -n MySolution
   ```

   Replace `MySolution` with your preferred name.

2. **Create the Library Project**:

   Run the following commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
   dotnet new classlib -n MyLibrary -o MyLibrary
   ```

   This creates a new directory named `MyLibrary` and initializes it as a class library.

3. **Add the Library to the Solution**:

   To include the library in the solution, run:

   ```bash
   dotnet sln add MyLibrary/MyLibrary.csproj
   ```

4. **Link to Other Projects or Libraries**:

   You can **add a project reference**:

   ```bash
   dotnet add reference ..\Path\To\AnotherProject.csproj
   ```

   Or **add a package reference**:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package MyPackage
   ```

5. **Build the Solution**:

   To ensure everything is linked up correctly, build the solution with:

   ```bash
    dotnet build
   ```

   The class library and any linked projects should build without errors.
